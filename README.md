# Base santiment.net landing page (Astro)

This is the source for [`Base Landing Page`](https://santiment.net).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v20 – JavaScript runtime environment
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= v8.x – package manager

## Running locally

If you have `pnpm` you can run the app simply:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

##

This is going to run the app on port 3000, so [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) should be accessible.
